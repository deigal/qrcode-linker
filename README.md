# üéì QR Code Linker

A secure, Azure-hosted web application that automates the process of linking student IDs to unique QR codes. Designed for educational environments, this system enables a professor to generate, print, and track QR codes, while students scan and submit their IDs through a simple web interface.

---

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Automate the lifecycle of QR code creation, printing, and linking
- Ensure secure, one-time association between QR codes and student IDs
- Prevent abuse through non-predictable URLs, CAPTCHA, and token expiry
- Deploy using CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration and reliability
